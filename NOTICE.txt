Source Code Forks (Copy + Paste + Modify)
=========================================

This product contains source code that was originally copied + pasted
from its original project into this project's sourcetree. In all
cases, the original source codes have a permissive license. The reason
for these copy+paste forks was typically to support major,
not-backwards-compatible, modifications.

The following source code was treated this way:

OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)
------------------------

- https://github.com/g-truc/glm
- Licensed under the MIT license
- Copyright (c) 2005 - G-Truc Creation
- The source code for `glm::vec2`, `glm::vec3`, `glm::vec4`, `glm::vec<L, T>`, `glm::quat`
  `glm::mat3`, `glm::mat4`, and `glm::mat` and associated functions (e.g. `glm::dot`, and
  `glm::conjugate` were copied into OpenSim Creator's `Maths/` library, followed by gradually
  changing them to meet OpenSim Creator's requirements.

imgui_impl_sdl2
---------------

- https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/v1.91.2/backends/imgui_impl_sdl2.cpp
- Licensed under the MIT license
- Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Omar Cornut
- The source code was copied + pasted into OpenSim Creator's UI backend module, followed by
  gradually modifying it to instead use the `App` API that OpenSimCreator hosts.

jam-plugin
----------

- https://github.com/opensim-jam-org/jam-plugin
- Licensed under the Apache 2.0 license
- Copyright (c) 2020 Colin Smith
- The source code for some OpenSim components hosted in that repository were copied+pasted
  into ``OpenSimCreatorThirdPartyPlugins` and modified such that they can be built+shipped
  within OpenSim Creator.

ImGuizmo
--------

- https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo
- Licensed under the MIT license
- Copyright (c) 2016 Cedric Guillemet
- The source code was copied + pasted into OpenSim Creator's UI code, followed by modifying
  it to fix various application-specific issues (e.g. ability to reset the global context)
  in a backwards-compatibility-breaking way. It was then subsequently refactored to match the
  rest of the project.
