  abstract = {Movement is fundamental to human and animal life, emerging through interaction of complex neural, muscular, and skeletal systems. Study of movement draws from and contributes to diverse fields, including biology, neuroscience, mechanics, and robotics. OpenSim unites methods from these fields to create fast and accurate simulations of movement, enabling two fundamental tasks. First, the software can calculate variables that are difficult to measure experimentally, such as the forces generated by muscles and the stretch and recoil of tendons during movement. Second, OpenSim can predict novel movements from models of motor control, such as kinematic adaptations of human gait during loaded or inclined walking. Changes in musculoskeletal dynamics following surgery or due to human–device interaction can also be simulated; these simulations have played a vital role in several applications, including the design of implantable mechanical devices to improve human grasping in individuals with paralysis. OpenSim is an extensible and user-friendly software package built on decades of knowledge about computational modeling and simulation of biomechanical systems. OpenSim’s design enables computational scientists to create new state-of-the-art software tools and empowers others to use these tools in research and clinical applications. OpenSim supports a large and growing community of biomechanics and rehabilitation researchers, facilitating exchange of models and simulations for reproducing and extending discoveries. Examples, tutorials, documentation, and an active user forum support this community.

  abstract = {This simulation study aimed to explore the effects of mass and mass distribution of powered ankle-foot orthoses, on net joint moments and individual muscle forces throughout the lower limb. Using OpenSim inverse kinematics, dynamics, and static optimization tools, the gait cycles of ten subjects were analyzed. The biomechanical models of these subjects were appended with ideal powered ankle-foot orthoses of different masses and actuator positions, as to determine the effect that these design factors had on the subject’s kinetics during normal walking. It was found that when the mass of the device was distributed more distally and posteriorly on the leg, both the net joint moments and overall lower limb muscle forces were more negatively impacted. However, individual muscle forces were found to have varying results which were attributed to the flow-on effect of the orthosis, the antagonistic pairing of muscles, and how the activity of individual muscles affect each other. It was found that mass and mass distribution of powered ankle-foot orthoses could be optimized as to more accurately mimic natural kinetics, reducing net joint moments and overall muscle forces of the lower limb, and must consider individual muscles as to reduce potentially detrimental muscle fatigue or muscular disuse.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the computational performances of two direct methods for solving large-scale, nonlinear, optimal control problems in human movement. Direct shooting and direct collocation were implemented on an 8-segment, 48-muscle model of the body (24 muscles on each side) to compute the optimal control solution for maximum-height jumping. Both algorithms were executed on a freely-available musculoskeletal modeling platform called OpenSim. Direct collocation converged to essentially the same optimal solution up to 249 times faster than direct shooting when the same initial guess was assumed (3.4 h of CPU time for direct collocation vs. 35.3 days for direct shooting). The model predictions were in good agreement with the time histories of joint angles, ground reaction forces and muscle activation patterns measured for subjects jumping to their maximum achievable heights. Both methods converged to essentially the same solution when started from the same initial guess, but computation time was sensitive to the initial guess assumed. Direct collocation demonstrates exceptional computational performance and is well suited to performing predictive simulations of movement using large-scale musculoskeletal models.},

  abstract = { Birds and crocodylians are the only remaining members of Archosauria (ruling reptiles) and they exhibit major differences in posture and gait, which are polar opposites in terms of locomotor strategies. Their broader lineages (Avemetatarsalia and Pseudosuchia) evolved a multitude of locomotor modes in the Triassic and Jurassic periods, including several occurrences of bipedalism. The exact timings and frequencies of bipedal origins within archosaurs, and thus their ancestral capabilities, are contentious. It is often suggested that archosaurs ancestrally exhibited some form of bipedalism. Euparkeria capensis is a central taxon for the investigation of locomotion in archosaurs due to its phylogenetic position and intermediate skeletal morphology, and is argued to be representative of facultative bipedalism in this group. However, no studies to date have biomechanically tested if bipedality was feasible in Eupakeria. Here, we use musculoskeletal models and static simulations in its hindlimb to test the influences of body posture and muscle parameter estimation methods on locomotor potential. Our analyses show that the resulting negative pitching moments around the centre of mass were prohibitive to sustainable bipedality. We conclude that it is unlikely that Euparkeria was facultatively bipedal, and was probably quadrupedal, rendering the inference of ancestral bipedal abilities in Archosauria unlikely. }

	abstract = {Musculoskeletal models for multibody dynamic analysis provide unique insights into human and animal movement. Although some biomechanical simulators provide model-building tools, these presuppose substantial preprocessing by the user, and resulting models are generally not cross-platform compatible. Thus, the workflow from anatomical 3D scans to musculoskeletal model is time-consuming, requiring numerous processing and conversions steps between software packages, and the process differs between simulators. Despite the popularity of musculoskeletal modelling within biomechanics, no cross-platform, open source software package exists for constructing musculoskeletal models.Here, I introduce MuSkeMo: A software suite for defining 3D musculoskeletal models entirely within Blender (open-source 3D computer graphics software). MuSkeMo provides a visual interface, enabling users to interactively define all aspects of a musculoskeletal model (including rigid bodies, skeletal geometry, joint centres, muscles, landmarks, and body-fixed reference frames). MuSkeMo can calculate 3D inertial tensors from arbitrary meshes (e.g., from CT scans), and also implements automated convex-hull based mass-estimation approaches from the literature. Joints can be defined using shape-fitting of bony surfaces, and muscles can wrap around primitive shapes.Models can be analyzed within MuSkeMo using popular pose-sampling procedures, or exported to multiple text-based formats for use in biomechanical simulators. A conversion script to OpenSim is included.MuSkeMo is compatible with models created for popular biomechanical simulators (OpenSim and Gaitsym). MuSkeMo can import these models and simulation trajectories, enabling users to create publication-ready stills and animations with Blender{\textquoteright}s ray tracing. These visualisations include volumetric muscles based on the contractile parameters, which can be more visually intuitive than traditional constant-diameter tube segments.Whether the end goal is a highly-detailed subject-specific human model, or a simplified animal model, MuSkeMo includes features that can aid this process. By consolidating many elements of common model construction workflows into a cohesive package, MuSkeMo substantially simplifies musculoskeletal modelling.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In this study, the method for scaling musculotendon parameters published by Winby et al. (2008), J. Biomech. 41, 1682–1688, has been reformulated, generalized and applied to two cases of practical interest: 1) the adjustment of muscle parameters in the entire lower limb following linear scaling of a generic model and 2) their estimation “from scratch” in a subject specific model of the hip joint created from medical images. In the first case, the procedure maintained the muscles׳ operating range between models with mean errors below 2.3% of the reference model normalized fiber length value. In the second case, a subject specific model of the hip joint was created using segmented bone geometries and muscle volumes publicly available for a cadaveric specimen from the Living Human Digital Library (LHDL). Estimated optimal fiber lengths were found to be consistent with those of a previously published dataset for all 27 considered muscle bundles except gracilis. However, computed tendon slack lengths differed from tendon lengths measured in the LHDL cadaver, suggesting that tendon slack length should be determined via optimization in subject-specific applications. Overall, the presented methodology could adjust the parameters of a scaled model and enabled the estimation of muscle parameters in newly created subject specific models. All data used in the analyses are of public domain and a tool implementing the algorithm is available at https://simtk.org/home/opt_muscle_par.}
