# Windows install/packaging:
#
#     - copy `osc.exe` and all of its RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES into the `bin/` dir
#
#     - this creates a "fat" install, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44909846/cmake-exe-cant-find-dll
#
#     - packaging: uses NSIS.exe : get it from https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download

# package any required system libraries (C/C++ runtimes)
include(InstallRequiredSystemLibraries)

# install osc.exe and all of its RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES
