Tutorial 4: Make a Hand
=======================

In this tutorial, we will be using OpenSim Creator to create a basic human hand from some mesh files:

**TODO: basic human hand model in osim editor**

This is a more-advanced tutorial that builds on top of several techniques that were demonstrated in previous tutorials:

* :ref:`tut1`: Adding components into an osim, editing component values
* :ref:`tut2`: Adding forces into a model, making refinements/simplications based on preliminary simulation results
* :ref:`tut3`: Importing meshes and placing bodies/joints with the mesh importer

Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you consult those tutorials if you aren't sure about what's going on in this tutorial.

Here, we will be using those techniques *ad nauseam* to create a model with many more bodies and joints. We will then explore how **stations** can be used to mark "points of interest" on a model, followed by using those points of interest to create **muscles** (effectively, advanced forces) between bodies in the model, which will enable you to create a biomechanical model.
