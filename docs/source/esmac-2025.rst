ESMAC 2025 Workshop
===================

The OpenSim Creator team will present a model building and warping workshop at
the European Society for Movement Analysis in Adults and Children (ESMAC). This
documentation is a guidebook for that workshop.


üìÖ When/Where
-------------

The workshop shall be held at the ESMAC conference on the afternoon of the 10th
September 2025. The exact time and room is still to-be-decided (TBD).


üßëüèΩ‚Äçüî¨ Organizers and Expert Helpers
-------------------------------------

- Adam Kewley
- Ajay Seth
- TBD (Judith/mmreazie?)


üë©‚Äçüíª Before You Arrive
-----------------------

We recommend attendants prepare for the workshop in the following ways:

- **Download and install OpenSim Creator**. The work sessions will focus
  on using OpenSim Creator's features for model building and warping.
  The :ref:`installation` page outlines the procedure.
- **(optional) Download and install OpenSim**. To answer attendants' specific
  modelling questions, team members may recommend OpenSim. It can be downloaded
  from the `OpenSim SimTK Page`_.
- **(optional) Familiarize Yourself with the basics of OpenSim/modelling**. The
  work sessions may be easier to follow if you have already gone through an early
  tutorial such as :doc:`make-a-pendulum`.

**If you are already working on an OpenSim model**, bring it along. The workshop
is structured such that work sessions' walkthroughs and exercises can *usually* be
completed with any model. The work sessions are an ideal time to ask specific
questions about your model.


üó∫Ô∏è Workshop Overview
--------------------

The workshop will last around four hours, with a thirty minute break in the
middle. There will be three presentations at the start, middle, and end of
the workshop.

**TODO**: rough planning diagram

The first half of the workshop will be focused on model building. The work
session will include feature demonstrations by the team, specific model
building walkthroughs (e.g. building a basic model), and a chance for attendants
to explore OpenSim Creator or work on their own model with help from the team.

The second half of the workshop will focus on model scaling/warping. We
will introduce our latest beta workflow, :doc:`the-model-warper`, and explain
how it can be used to create subject-specific models. The work session will be
a chance for attendants to give this workflow a try and provide us with feedback
about it - this time can also be used to continue exploring OpenSim Creator and
build models.


üìö Workshop Materials

Presentation: Model Building with OpenSim Creator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**TODO**: OpenSim and Model Building Presentation. Target duration is 15-30
minutes and should include:

- Welcome, quick overview of the workshop plan (above), direct people to the
  documentation pages, etc.
- A basic OpenSim ecosystem overview (e.g. briefly mentioning OpenCap, Add
  Bioinformatics, etc.)
- A brief historical/development overview behind OpenSim Creator (major feature
  releases, old screenshots, development methodology, etc.)
- Introduce/start the work session. Introduce walkthroughs, exercises, etc. Give
  the attendants something concrete they can do, even if they aren't already
  working on a model.

Work Session: Model Building
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**TODO**: work session exercises, example models, walkthroughs, etc. Target
duration is 1h30-1h45 and should include:

- Direct people to the tutorials or ESMAC-specific exercises. Maybe shape
  it such that morphometric (mesh) scaling is an available thing they can
  work on if they are mostly here for the 2nd half of the workshop.
- On-whiteboard walkthroughs about specific features in OpenSim.
- Staff/team milling around answering questions, and so on.

Break
^^^^^

Chill out for 30 minutes. Stretch your legs, chat to other attendants, etc.

Presentation: Model Warping with OpenSim Creator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**TODO**: Model warping presentation. Target duration is 15-25 minutes and
should include:

- Quick historical overview of model scaling in OpenSim
- Why attendants might need non-linear model scaling
- The problems that non-linear scaling brings
- Our solutions to some of the low-level problems (e.g. :doc:`station-defined-frames`)
- Our overall solution (:doc:`the-model-warper`)

Work Session: Model Warping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Invite attendants to work through :doc:`the-model-warper`
- Ask for feedback, make it clear that it's a beta workflow and needs additions etc.
- If attendants need something else to do then model building is a good fallback


Presentation: Closing Thoughts, Outlook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**TODO**: Final closing presentation. Target duration is 10-20 minutes and should
include:

- Quick overview of what's been covered, we hope attendants enjoyed it, etc.
- Outlook, what we're planning on working on in the future, project direction,
  etc.
- Direct attendants to post-workshop actions (feedback, surveys, things they can
  do once they get home)
- Acknowledgements, thank you, see you around.


‚ö° Post-Workshop Actions
-------------------------

- **TODO**: ask for feedback about the software, general design directions, etc.
- **TODO**: ask for feedback via a questionnaire?
- **TODO**: mention our upcoming project, maybe someone's interested in
  collaborating on it?
