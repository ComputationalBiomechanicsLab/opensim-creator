ESMAC 2025
==========

The OpenSim Creator team will present a model building and warping workshop at
the European Society for Movement Analysis in Adults and Children (ESMAC). This
documentation is a guidebook for that workshop.


üìÖ When/Where is it?
--------------------

The workshop shall be held at the ESMAC conference on the afternoon of the 10th
September 2025. The exact time/room is still to-be-decided (TBD).


üë©‚Äçüíª Prepratory Steps
----------------------

We recommend attendants prepare for the workshop in the following ways:

- **Download and install OpenSim Creator**. Most of the workshop's content
  will focus on OpenSim Creator's features for model building and warping.
- **Download and install OpenSim**. The workshop may also involve using
  parts of OpenSim to help build or analyze OpenSim models, so you should
  also install OpenSim.
- **Familiarize Yourself with the basics of OpenSim/modelling**. We
  will try to keep the content simple, but it will be much easier to follow
  if you have already played around with some.

üó∫Ô∏è Content Overview
-------------------

TODO: explanation of the various phases of the workshop, maybe a little
planning diagram so that people can see where they are as we progress
through the topics.


üìö Workshop Materials
---------------------

The materials for the workshop are published openly and will be hosted
as part of OpenSim Creator's documentation after the workshop has ended. This
means you can come back here if you need a refresher.

Other educators and workshop organizers are invited to use these materials
however they please.
