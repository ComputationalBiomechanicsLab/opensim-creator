Make a Bouncing Block
=====================

In this tutorial, we will be making a bouncing block using OpenSim Creator:

    :width: 60%

    The model that's made in this tutorial. It is a three-body system with a spring attached between the head to the foot. Contact geometries are used to make the model bounce on the floor, and constraints are used to prevent it from rolling around (:download:`ðŸ“¥ download model <_static/tut2_constraints-added.osim>`).

In :ref:`tut1`, we created a pendulum: one of the most basic physical systems that can be modelled. This tutorial reinforces concepts from that tutorial by building a slightly more complex model that contains **collisions**, **forces**, and **constraints**. This tutorial builds the model *incrementally* (i.e. from the ground up), so that we can explore each model-making decision one step at a time.

.. warning::

    This tutorial also assumes that you have already completed :ref:`tut1`. Because of that, the content here will skip over some steps. If you feel lost at any point, there should be partial solutions available along the way. Keep an eye out for the :download:`ðŸ“¥ download model <_static/tut2_constraints-added.osim>` links.


Topics Covered by this Tutorial
-------------------------------

* Creating a slightly more advanced (than :ref:`tut1`) model that also contains **collisions**, **forces**, and **constraints**.
* Editing the collision surfaces/forces (orientations, radii, etc.).
* How forces are used in OpenSim models. An example of how they can be used.
* Why constraints are sometimes necessary in OpenSim models.


Step: Create the Foot
---------------------

Because of how OpenSim computes a model's spatial layout, the most straightforward way to develop a new OpenSim model is to start at whichever body will be directly attached to ground (e.g. ``foot``) followed by adding bodies that are, in turn, attached to that (e.g. ``knee``). Starting from the "middle" (e.g. ``knee``), or a "leaf", of a model's topology graph is more challenging because the position and orientation of those entities may change when they are attached to bodies that are (topographically) closer to ground.

.. note::

    The body that is attached to ground does **not** need to be the body that is spatially closest to ground in the model. It just needs to be whichever body you think should be positioned relative to ground. In this tutorial, we are starting at the ``foot``, which happens to also be the body that's closest to the ground. Conversely, OpenSim Creator contains an example model, ``bouncing_block.osim``, which is similar to the model we will build here, but built from the ``head`` towards the ``foot``.

    The reason that this tutorial builds this model from the ``foot`` upwards is so that we can experiment with collisions earlier in the tutorial. If we built the model from the ``head``, we would have to wait until the ``knee``, ``foot``, and ``foot_collision`` were added before we could experiment with collisions.

The first thing we need to add to our model is the ``foot`` body. As explained in :ref:`tut1`, all bodies (which are frames) need to be attached to other frames in the model and, ultimately, attached to ground. In our model, the ``foot`` will be an (initially) freely-moving element in the scene, so we will directly attach it to the ground with a ``FreeJoint``.

Using similar steps to what was taught in :ref:`tut1`:

* Add a body called ``foot`` into the model. It should have a mass of ``1 kg`` (the default) and be joined to ``ground`` with a ``FreeJoint`` called ``foot_to_ground``. Attach a ``Sphere`` geometry to it.
* Click the sphere and change its ``Appearance`` to a red color.

You can then raise ``foot`` above the ground slightly by altering the ``foot_to_ground`` joint's ``ty`` coordinate:

* Select the ``foot_to_ground`` joint
* Select the ``ty`` coordinate
* Change ``ty``'s ``default_value`` from ``0.0`` to ``0.5``

This should produce a model with a red sphere (``foot``) that is raised above the ground:

    The model after adding the ``foot`` body and changing ``foot_to_ground``'s ``ty`` to ``0.5`` (:download:`ðŸ“¥ download model <_static/tut2_added-foot.osim>`)

.. note::

    Why do we change the ``ty`` coordinate, rather than changing (e.g.) the ``translation`` property of ``foot_offset``?

    In :ref:`tut1` we moved bodies around by altering the ``translation`` property of offset frames. Here, we are changing the ``ty`` coordinate. This exploits the fact that ``FreeJoint`` s have alterable translation coordinates.

    Both of these approaches for moving bodies around in the model have equivalent side-effects. However, coordinates have the added benefit of being user-editable. The official `OpenSim GUI`_ contains a ``coordinates`` panel that lets users easily change coordinates. This enables users to (e.g.) later change ``ty`` to make the model start higher off the ground.


Step: Add Contact Surfaces & Forces
-----------------------------------

If you simulate the model at this point, the ``foot`` will just fall through the floor. The reason this happens is because the chequered floor and red sphere are decorative and the ``foot`` body is effectively a 0D point in space.

In order to give these things a "size" that can "collide", we need to explicitly add ``ContactGeometry`` into the model at locations where we *logically* expect collisions to take place. In this case, we will add ``ContactGeometry`` at the same location as the decorations.

To attach a collidable floor (a ``ContactHalfSpace``) to the ground of the model:

* Click the ``add contact geometry`` button, then ``ContactHalfSpace``
* Give the ``ContactHalfSpace`` the following properties:

.. figure:: _static/tut2_floor-properties.png

    Properties for the ``floor_contact`` component (a ``ContactHalfSpace``) attached to the ground. Careful that ``orientation`` is set to ``-1.5707`` in Z. ``+1.5707`` behaves differently, because a ``ContactHalfSpace`` only collides on one side.


To attach a collidable sphere (a ``ContactSphere``) to ``foot``:

* Click the ``add contact geometry`` button, then click ``ContactSphere``
* Give the ``ContactSphere`` the following properties:

.. figure:: _static/tut2_footcontact-properties.png

    Properties for the ``foot_contact`` component (a ``ContactSphere``). The ``radius`` is set to match the ``Sphere`` decoration used on the ``foot``. The ``ContactSphere`` is attached to ``foot`` so that collisions it encounters affect ``foot``. **Note**: You can edit the ``radius`` property of ``foot_contact`` if you can't see it in the scene. It may be hidden inside the ``foot`` sphere (they have the same radius).

With those two contact geometries added, the model now contains enough contact geometry to model the collisions we are interested in. However, if you try to simulate this model you will find that ``foot`` still just falls through the floor ðŸ˜•. What's going on?

In OpenSim, contact geometries only express a geometry that *may* participate in contact (collision) detection. They do not express the *force* that is generated whenever contact occurs. We need to separately add a suitable contact force (in this case, a ``HuntCrossleyForce``) into the model. The force handles what *physically* happens to the model (i.e. which *forces* are applied to model) whenever a collision occurs.

To add a contact force (``HuntCrossleyForce``) to the model:

* Click the ``add force/muscle`` button
* Click ``HuntCrossleyForce``
* Click ``add`` to add the force and close the popup
* Select the force
* In the properties editor, click ``add contact geometry`` and add ``floor_contact`` and ``foot_contact`` to the force

With the contact force added, a simulation of this model should show ``foot`` hit ``floor``, bounce a little, then stop. You can change the ``HuntCrossleyForce``'s properties to change how stiff the contact force is, how much energy is dissipated by the contact, etc.

.. figure:: _static/tut2_collision-forces-added.png
    :width: 60%

    The model after adding ``floor_contact``, ``foot_contact`` and a ``HuntCrossleyForce``. Simulating (``Ctrl+R``) the model should show the ``foot`` sphere fall through the scene until it collides with the surface. It should then bounce a little and stop (:download:`ðŸ“¥ download model <_static/tut2_added-contact-stuff.osim>`).


Step: Attach the Knee & Head to the Foot
----------------------------------------

The next step is to add a "knee" and "head" to our ``foot``. This mostly involves the body-addition steps that were previously explained in :ref:`tut1`.

To add the ``knee`` to the model:

* Add a body called ``knee`` into the model. It should have a mass of ``1 kg`` and be joined to ``foot`` with a ``PinJoint`` called ``foot_to_knee``. Attach a sphere geometry to it.
* Change the ``foot_offset`` of the ``foot_to_knee`` joint from ``(0, 0, 0)`` to ``(0, 0.5, 0)``, so that the ``foot`` is offset from the origin of the ``foot_to_knee`` and ``knee`` is co-located with it (i.e. it swings at the knee).
* Make the sphere geometry red

To add the ``head`` to the model:

* Add a body called ``head`` into the model. It should have a mass of ``1 kg`` and be joined to ``knee`` with a ``PinJoint`` called ``knee_to_head``. Attach a ``Brick``. Attach a brick geometry to it.
* Change the ``knee_offset`` of the ``knee_to_head`` joint from ``(0, 0, 0)`` to ``(0, 0.5, 0)``, so that the ``knee`` is offset from the origin of ``knee_to_head`` and ``head`` is co-located with it (i.e. it swings at the head).
* Make the cube geometry red

These steps should create all the necessary bodies in the system, but it will look a little bit unusual (the "links" are missing):

.. figure:: _static/tut2_bodies-added.png
    :width: 60%

    The model after adding the ``knee`` and ``head`` bodies. The bodies are joined to each over with ``PinJoint`` s that pivot on the knee and head respectively. The model looks unusual because there are no visual "links" between the bodies and because the model isn't angled yet (:download:`ðŸ“¥ download model <_static/tut2_bodies-added.osim>`).


Much like at the end of :ref:`tut1`, we can make the model look better by adding extra geometry between the bodies. This can be achieved by attaching decorative geometry to offset frames placed between the blocks.

To add a decorative link between the ``foot`` and ``knee``:

* Select the ``foot`` body, add an offset frame to it with the ``add offset frame`` button
* Set the offset frame's ``translation`` property to ``(0.0, 0.25, 0.0)`` so that the offset frame sits between ``foot`` and ``knee``
* Attach a ``Brick`` geometry to the offset frame
* Change the ``Brick``'s ``half_widths`` property to something like ``(0.025, 0.25, 0.025)`` to create a thin "rod" between ``foot`` and ``knee``


To add a decorative link between the ``knee`` and ``head``:

* Select ``knee``, add an offset frame to it with the ``add offset frame`` button
* Set the offset frame's ``translation`` property to ``(0.0, 0.25, 0.0)`` so that it sits between ``knee`` and ``head``
* Attach a ``Brick`` geometry to the offset frame
* Change the ``Brick``'s ``half_widths`` property to something like ``(0.025, 0.25, 0.025)`` to create a thin "rod" between ``knee`` and ``head``


These steps add *decorative* features to the model that make it easier to see what's going on. After doing them, you should have something that looks like this:

.. figure:: _static/tut2_decorations-added.png
    :width: 60%

    The model after adding decorative bricks between the ``foot`` and the ``knee`` and between the ``knee`` and the ``head`` (:download:`ðŸ“¥ download model <_static/tut2_decorations-added.osim>`).


If you try simulating this model, you will find that it falls vertically and remains mostly motionless. The reason why that happens is because all of the bodies in the model (``foot``, ``knee``, and ``head``) are vertically aligned along Y.

To make the simulation more interesting, we are going to angle the whole model and also change the initial joint angle of ``foot_to_knee`` to give the knee a "kink". To do this:

* Angle the whole model by selecting the ``rz`` coordinate in the ``ground_to_foot`` ``FreeJoint``. Change the coordinate's ``default_value`` property to ``0.698``. 
* Give the knee a "kink" by selecting the ``rz`` coordinate in the ``foot_to_knee`` ``PinJoint``. Change the coordinate's ``default_value`` property to ``-1.396``.

These steps should put the model into a more interesting arrangement:

    :width: 60%

    The model after altering the ``ground_to_foot``'s and ``foot_to_knee``'s ``rz`` values. Altering those values puts the model into a more interesting arrangement (:download:`ðŸ“¥ download model <_static/tut2_angles-added.osim>`).


Step: Add a Spring between ``foot`` and ``head``
------------------------------------------------

We have now added all of the the bodies and joints that make up the model. However, the only forces acting on the model are gravity and the foot collision. Consequently, a simulation of the model won't be very impressive. The model will fall a little, then ``foot`` will collide with ``floor``, then the rest of the (non-colliding) model will roll around and clip through the floor.

The reason this model is unexciting is because there are no forces between the model's bodies. We have attached three bodies (``foot``, ``knee``, and ``head``) with two ``PinJoint`` s and let them drop through space. The joints merely enforce constraints between the bodies. So the model is acts like a passive hinged device that flops around.

We can add **forces** to this model to make it more interesting. Specifically, we will add a ``PointToPointSpring`` between the ``foot`` and ``head``, which will make the model's head "bounce" away from the foot whenever it gets too close (e.g. when the model hits the floor).

To add a ``PointToPointSpring`` between ``foot`` and ``head``:

* Click the ``add force/muscle`` button
* Click ``PointToPointSpring``
* Give the spring the following properties:

.. figure:: _static/tut2_add-spring-popup.png
    :width: 60%

    Properties for a ``PointToPointSpring`` between the ``foot`` and the ``head`` in the model. The spring's ``stiffness`` and ``rest_length`` properties are chosen to try and make the model equilibrate towards the ``foot`` being separated from the ``head`` slightly (after a few bounces).


If you simulate the model after adding the spring, you should see that the model hits the floor, collides, bounces a little bit, and then starts to roll:

.. figure:: _static/tut2_spring-added.png
    :width: 60%

    The model after adding a ``PointToPointSpring`` between the ``foot`` and the ``head``. The spring prevents the ``head`` from clipping through the ``foot`` and makes the simulation more interesting-looking. However, when simulating, the model bounces around a little bit and begins to roll around. This is because the model isn't constrained along the vertical axis (:download:`ðŸ“¥ download model <_static/tut2_spring-added.osim>`).


Step: Constrain ``foot`` and ``head`` to stay along Y
-----------------------------------------------------

The model is now *logically* complete--in the sense that it contains all of the mechanical components we want--but it isn't particularly *stable*. If you simulate the model, you will find that it bounces a little bit and then starts to roll around on its foot, rather than continuing to bounce up and down. 

The reason this happens is because the model isn't perfectly balanced. It is slightly heavier on knee-side, which causes the whole model to start leaning and, ultimately, roll around. One way to prevent this from happening is to add **constraints** into the model that prevent it from rolling.

One way to think of constraints is that they are extra "rules" that the model must obey. When the model is assembled and simulated, the simulator has to ensure that each state of the simulation obeys the these constraints. Constraints are commonly used to simplify models in some (acceptable) way.

OpenSim has support for a few different constraints, such as:

* Enforcing a constant distance between two frames in the model (``ConstantDistanceConstraint``)
* Enforcing that a frame "follows along" some other frame. E.g. that the frame is only allowed to be some distance along the Y axis of some other frame (``PointOnLineConstraint``)
* Enforcing that two frames must be at the same location and orientation (``WeldConstraint``)

For our model, we want to enforce that the ``foot`` and ``head`` are constrained to always be along the ``Y`` axis (i.e. ``X = 0 && Z = 0``). This enforces that both ``foot`` and ``head`` fall and bounce vertically, which means that the ``foot_to_head_spring`` is always bounced straight-on.

.. figure:: _static/tut2_foot-Y-lock-properties.png
    :width: 60%

    Properties for ``foot_Y_lock``. This constraint prevents the foot from being able to roll along the floor to a different X/Z coordinate in the scene by enforcing ``foot`` to *follow* the ``(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)`` line from ``ground``.

After adding that constraint, you should find that ``foot`` no longer rolls around, but ``head`` still freely swings around as much as it can. To fix ``head``, we also constrain it along the Y axis:

.. figure:: _static/tut2_head-y-lock-properties.png
    :width: 60%

    Properties for ``head_Y_lock``. This constraint prevents ``head`` from being able to swing around the ``foot`` wildly, which ensures that it always bounces towards ``foot`` straight-on.

With both of those constraints in place, the model now bounces up and down without rolling around. This is very useful for figuring out what tuning parameters (e.g. ``head`` weight, ``foot_to_head_spring`` stiffness) lead to an optimal bounce without having to *also* handle balancing.

.. figure:: _static/tut2_constraints-added.png
    :width: 60%

    The final model after adding ``PointOnLineConstraint`` s that make the ``head`` and ``foot`` bodies stay along the Y axis, rather than having the freedom to roll around (:download:`ðŸ“¥ download model <_static/tut2_constraints-added.osim>`).

.. note::

    Wait a second, did we just cheat ðŸ¤”? A "real" model wouldn't have these invisible constraints, right?

    Yes - technically. But using constraints in this way is a **design** choice. Design choices are dictated by *realities* and *needs*, rather than idealism. Do you *need* an ideal model, or will a simplified model adequately answer your question?

    Take this model as an example. If your main objective is to figure out which angles, masses, and spring strains lead to a perfectly balanced model (e.g. because ideally optimizing the model's *balance* is what you need), then you probably don't want to use constraints because they are interrupting the main objective of your model.

    Conversely, if your main objective is to roughly tune the model's spring and body masses to get the right amount of vertical "bounce", and you know that the model's overall balance isn't relevant (e.g. because you know the device is going to be bounced down a tube or linear rail), then you probably do want to use constraints because they will make it easier to focus on the main objective of your model.

    Choosing the right constraints is even more important with complex models. Sure, you *could* try to perfectly balance a perfectly-modelled human on a perfectly-designed bicycle, and ensure that the various muscle controls etc. keep the bike balanced, but getting that right will *probably* take a very long time (assuming it's even possible, given the number of parameters involved). Conversely, you could model a rougher human model on a simpler bicycle model that is constrained to only roll along a 2D plane. That would take significantly less time to model and might be "good enough" to answer your research question.

    The art of modelling is in figuring out which simplifications are suitable for your problem. There's a reason why physicists tend to model everything as a sphere - and frequently get away with it ðŸ˜‰.


(Optional) Extra Exercises
--------------------------

Now that you have a working model, you can experiment a little bit by doing these extra exercises.

* **Experiment with the body masses and spring parameters**. What happens if ``head`` is heavier? How does the spring ``stiffness`` affect how the model bounces? Can the floor's contact forces be modified to reduce how much of the drop force is dissipated each bounce? Can you make it bounce for longer?

* **Try opening your model in the official OpenSim GUI**. Save your model to an ``.osim`` and open it in the official `OpenSim GUI`_. This should let you edit coordinates, plot things, etc. The official GUI has features that OpenSim Creator does not have. The benefit of using open file types (``.osim``) is that you can use multiple tools with your model file.


Next Steps
----------

This tutorial was similar to :ref:`tut1`, but it introduced some of the more practical parts of designing a model. Things like adding **collision geometry**, adding **forces**, and deciding on **constraints**. These are all important parts of the model-building process that come up repeatably when designing OpenSim models.

As you experienced in this tutorial, a time-consuming step of building an OpenSim model can be initially adding and placing the bodies/joints. The next tutorial, :ref:`tut3`, introduces an alternative approach for performing these first steps.
