Tutorial 3: Use the Mesh Importer
=================================

In this tutorial, we will be using the mesh importer feature of OpenSim Creator to create a pendulum:


PENDULUM IMAGE IN MESHIMPORTER


Although the model we will make in this tutorial is effectively an extension of :ref:`tut1`, the **method** used here is different. Here, we will be using the specialized mesh importer feature of OpenSim Creator to create the model, rather than building the model directly in the OpenSim model (``.osim``) editor. The mesh importer can only add meshes, bodies, joints, and stations into the model, but can be easier to use when building a *new* models.

The reason why this approach is introduced later in the tutorial series is because it's helpful to be familiar with OpenSim model building/editing *before* using the importer. The mesh importer ultimately exports an OpenSim model that you can then modify/simulate in the model editor (as in previous tutorials) or in the official OpenSim GUI, so it is recommended that you feel comfortable with OpenSim model building (i.e. the content in :ref:`tut1` and :ref:`tut2`) before trying this.
