OpenSim Creator Documentation
=============================

OpenSim Creator is a UI for building OpenSim models. It is a standalone UI that
is designed as a proof-of-concept, with the intent that some of its features may
be merged into the official `OpenSim GUI`_. These pages are the official documentation
for OpenSim creator.

.. warning::
    These documentation pages are work-in-progress ðŸš§. If they aren't helpful
    enough then feel free to open a ticket on OpenSim Creator's `GitHub`_ page.
    This documentation is kept in the project repository `here <https://github.com/adamkewley/opensim-creator/tree/master/docs>`_ so, if you know
    what you're doing, you can also try to submit a PR.


Getting Started
---------------

This is a quick guide for new users. If you have already installed and used OpenSim Creator and are here for specific documentation pages, go to the `Table of Contents`_ section to find something specific.

* Grab an OpenSim Creator release from the `releases <https://github.com/adamkewley/opensim-creator/releases>`_ page on GitHub. Make sure you download a release that is suitable for your machine. Install it according to the installer's instructions.

* Boot OpenSim Creator by either:

  * (Windows): Search for "osc" in the start menu and open that. Alternatively, browse to your install location (default: ``C:\Program Files\osc (VERSION)\bin\osc.exe``)
  * (Mac): Search for "osc" in the finder (Super+Space, search, enter). Alternatively, browse to your install location (default: ``/Applications/osc (VERSION)``)
  * (Linux): Search for "osc" in your desktop. Alternatively, browse to your install location (default: ``/opt/osc (VERSION)/bin/osc``)

* Hopefully ðŸ¤ž, the main OpenSim Creator UI will open, which means you're good to go ðŸŽ‰.

  * You'll probably want to initially explore and experiment with the UI by loading some of the example files, which are shown on OpenSim Creator's splash screen. I'd reccommend ``double_pendulum.osim``  for a basic model and ``ToyDropLanding.osim`` for something "meatier"

  * Once you feel comfortable with the basics (opening/creating files, moving around the UI), then you are ready to start :ref:`tut1`
