.. warning::
    These documentation pages are work-in-progress ðŸš§. If they aren't helpful
    enough then feel free to open a ticket on OpenSim Creator's `GitHub`_ page.
    This documentation is kept in the project repository `here <https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/tree/main/docs>`_ so, if you know
    what you're doing, you can also try to submit a PR.

.. _gettingstarted:

Getting Started
---------------

* **Get an OpenSim Creator release.** Grab it from the  `ðŸ“¥ releases <https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases>`_ page on GitHub. Make sure you download a release that is suitable for your machine. Install it according to the installer's instructions.

* **Boot OpenSim Creator**:

  * **On Windows**: Search for "osc" or "OpenSimCreator" in the start menu and open the application. Alternatively, browse to your install location (default: ``C:\Program Files\OpenSimCreator\bin\osc.exe``).
  * **On Mac**: Search for "osc" or "OpenSimCreator" in the finder (Super+Space, search, enter). Alternatively, browse to your install location (default: ``/Applications/osc.app``).
  * **On Ubuntu**: Search for "osc" in your desktop. Alternatively, browse to your install location (default: ``/opt/osc/bin/osc``).

* **Explore the UI**. You'll probably want to initially explore and experiment with the UI by loading some of the example files, which are shown on OpenSim Creator's splash screen. We recommend ``double_pendulum.osim`` if you want something basic, or ``ToyDropLanding.osim`` if you want something "meatier".

* **Work through the tutorials**. Once you feel comfortable with the basics (opening/creating files, moving around the UI), then you are ready to start ðŸ“– :ref:`tut1`.
