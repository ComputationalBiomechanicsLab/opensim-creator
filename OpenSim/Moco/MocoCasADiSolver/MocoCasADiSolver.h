/** This solver uses the CasADi library (https://casadi.org) to convert the
MocoProblem into a generic nonlinear programming problem. CasADi efficiently
calculcates the derivatives required to solve MocoProblem%s, and may
solve your MocoProblem more quickly that MocoTropterSolver. In general,
we hope that the feature sets of MocoCasADiSolver and MocoTropterSolver
are the same.
Note, however, that parameter optimization problems are implemented much
less efficiently in this solver; for parameter optimization, first try
MocoTropterSolver.

Sparsity
========
Direct collocation is fast because the derivative matrices (Jacobian and
Hessian) in the optimization problem are extremely sparse. By default,
CasADi determines the sparsity pattern of these matrices to be block
patterns: the individual functions that invoke OpenSim are treated as dense,
but this dense pattern is repeated in a sparse way. This is conservative
because we ensure that no "nonzeros" are accidentally treated as "zeros."
However, the problem may solve faster if we discover more "zeros."

See the optim_sparsity_detection setting for more information. In the case
of "random", we use 3 random trajectories and combine the resulting sparsity
patterns. The seed used for these 3 random trajectories is always exactly
the same, ensuring that the sparsity pattern is deterministic.

To explore the sparsity pattern for your problem, set optim_write_sparsity
and run the resulting files with the plot_casadi_sparsity.py Python script.

Finite difference scheme
========================
The "central" finite difference is more accurate but can be 2 times
slower than "forward" (tested on exampleSlidingMass). Sometimes, problems
may struggle to converge with "forward".

Parallelization
===============
By default, CasADi evaluate the integral cost integrand and the
differential-algebraic equations in parallel.
This should work fine for almost all models, but if you have custom model
components, ensure they are threadsafe. Make sure that threads do not
access shared resources like files or global variables at the same time.

You can turn off or change the number of parallel jobs used for individual
problems via either the OPENSIM_MOCO_PARALLEL environment variable (see
getMocoParallelEnvironmentVariable()) or the `parallel` property of this
class. For example, if you plan to solve two problems at the same time on
a machine with 4 processor cores, you could set OPENSIM_MOCO_PARALLEL to 2 to
use all 4 cores.

Note that there is overhead in the parallelization; if you plan to solve
many problems, it is better to turn off parallelization here and parallelize
the solving of your multiple problems using your system (e.g., invoke Moco in
multiple Terminals or Command Prompts).

Note that the `parallel` property overrides the environment variable,
allowing more granular control over parallelization. However, the
parallelization setting does not logically belong as a property, as it does
not affect the solution. We encourage you to use the environment variable
instead, as this allows different users to solve the same problem with the
parallelization they prefer.

Parameter variables
===================
By default, MocoCasADiSolver is much slower than MocoTroperSolver at
handling problems with MocoParameters. Many parameters require invoking
Model::initSystem() to take effect, and this function is expensive (for
CasADi, we must invoke this function for every time point, while in Tropter,
we can invoke the function only once for every NLP iterate). However, if you
know that all parameters in your problem do not require Model::initSystem(),
you can substantially speed up your optimization by setting the
parameters_require_initsystem property to false. Be careful, though: you
will end up with incorrect results if your parameter does indeed require
Model::initSystem(). To protect against this, ensure that you obtain the
same results whether this setting is true or false.

@note The software license of CasADi (LGPL) is more restrictive than that of
the rest of Moco (Apache 2.0).
@note This solver currently only supports systems for which \f$ \dot{q} = u
\f$ (e.g., no quaternions). */
