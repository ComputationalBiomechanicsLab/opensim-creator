 * A controller that computes controls for a model based on a linear combination
 * of a set of Input control signals and a set of synergy vectors. 
 * 
 * Each synergy vector represents a set of control weights that are multiplied 
 * by the Input control signals to compute the contribution to the total control
 * signal for that synergy. The synergy vectors should have the same size as the
 * number of actuators connected to the controller, and the controller expects
 * the number Input controls to be equal to the number of synergy vectors.
 * 
 * Added synergy vectors are named "synergy_vector_<index>", where <index> is
 * the index of the vector in the controller (e.g., "synergy_vector_0", 
 * "synergy_vector_1", etc.). Similarly, the Input control labels are named
 * "synergy_excitation_<index>" (e.g., "synergy_excitation_0",
 * "synergy_excitation_1", etc.).
 * 
 * @note In Moco, SynergyController%s in a model provided to MocoProblem will
 * be automatically detected. The Input controls for each SynergyController will
 * be given variable names based on the path to the controller appended with the
 * Input control labels (e.g., "/path/to/controller/synergy_excitation_0").
