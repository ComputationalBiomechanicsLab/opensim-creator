# Doxyfile 1.6.1

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

# Include configuration from the following doxyfile.

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description 
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer 
# a quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "For MATLAB, Python, Java, and C++ users"

# The ENABLED_SECTIONS tag can be used to enable conditional 
# documentation sections, marked by \if sectionname ... \endif.

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed 
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated 
# output files in an output format independent way. The create the layout file 
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option. 
# You can optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted 
# DoxygenLayout.xml will be used as the name of the layout file.

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be 
# put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.

# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user-defined cascading 
# style sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to 
# fine-tune the look of the HTML output. If the tag is left blank doxygen 
# will generate a default style sheet. Note that doxygen will try to copy 
# the style sheet file to the HTML output directory, so don't put your own 
# style sheet in the HTML output directory as well, or it will be erased!

HTML_STYLESHEET        = "@CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR@/doxygen_user.css"

# The HTML_EXTRA_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more extra images or 
# other source files which should be copied to the HTML output directory. Note 
# that these files will be copied to the base HTML output directory. Use the 
# $relpath$ marker in the HTML_HEADER and/or HTML_FOOTER files to load these 
# files. In the HTML_STYLESHEET file, use the file name only. Also note that 
# the files will be copied as-is; there are no commands or markers available.
