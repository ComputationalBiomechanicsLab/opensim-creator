# DEV osc configuration
#
# this is the configuration file used by developers that run OSC from the raw build directory,
# as opposed to the INSTALL configuration, which is what's used when running an installed version
# of OSC.
#
# This file is configured by CMake so that resources etc. are loaded from the developer's source
# dir, and such that any other development-centric flags (more verbose logging, whatever) are
# configured for typical dev debugging
#
# so, changing this will only affect developers - if you want to affect end-users then edit an
# INSTALL configuration file.
