# DEV osc configuration
#
# this is the configuration file used by developers that run OSC from the raw build directory,
# as opposed to the INSTALL configuration, which is what's used when running an installed version
# of OSC.
#
# This file is configured by CMake so that resources etc. are loaded from the developer's source
# dir, and such that any other development-centric flags (more verbose logging, whatever) are
# configured for typical dev debugging
#
# so, changing this will only affect developers - if you want to affect end-users then edit an
# INSTALL configuration file.

resources = "@CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR@/../resources"

# change this if you need OSC to print more information to the log
# log_level = "trace"  # trace < debug < info < warn < err < critical

# handy for auto-opening an in-development tab

# a scale factor that is multiplied by the number of physical pixels that comprise
# each 3D element in the UI (e.g. you can use this to downscale HighDPI viewports)
# graphics.render_scale = 1.0

# [model_editor]
#
# # tells the OpenSim model editor interface to enable/disable auto-reloading osim
# # files if the associated .osim file changes (#1000)
# monitor_osim_changes = false
