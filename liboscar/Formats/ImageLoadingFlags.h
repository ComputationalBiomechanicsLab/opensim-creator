        // encode vectors because the flipping operation mirrors the coordinate space that the pixels
        // are encoded in. To fix that, the implementation needs to flip the green (Y) component of
        // each pixel in the image. It shouldn't perform this fix if the pixels encode colors, though,

        //       because you baked the texture in Unreal Engine or 3ds Max) then you should _also_
        //       manually negate the green components in shaders, or memory.
