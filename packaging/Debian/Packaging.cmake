# Debian install/packaging:
#
#     - copy osc + libraries into a standard-layout dir
#           bin/  # executables
#           lib/  # libraries (.so)
#           resources/  # arch-independent runtime resources
#
#     - this dir is "done", and could be sent as a ZIP to an end-user
#
#     - **BUT** the way that OpenSim/osc is built assumes the user has all the
#       necessary runtime libraries available
#
#     - so the packaging step creates a .deb file that declares which runtime dependencies
#       a client should have (or automatically acquire via apt)
#
#     - note: the package assumes the user has a compatible OpenGL driver installed, servers
#             can try to "fake" this by running:
#
#           apt-get install libopengl0 libglx0 libglu1-mesa
