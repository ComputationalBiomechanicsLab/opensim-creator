A SpatialTransform is comprised of 6 TransformAxes (3 rotations and 3 translations) that define the spatial position of Child in Parent as a function of coordinates. Each transform axis has a function of joint coordinates that describes the motion about or along the transform axis. The order of the spatial transform is fixed with rotations first followed by translations. Subsequently, coupled motion (i.e., describing motion of two degrees of freedom as a function of one coordinate) is handled by transform axis functions that depend on the same coordinate(s).",  // broken: see above
