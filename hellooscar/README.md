# `hellooscar`: Minimal `liboscar` API usage

`helloscar` is a bare-minimum application executable target that uses the
`liboscar` API to render something in a window. Its main purpose is to verify
that `liboscar` is capable of running on the target platform without having
to also verify OpenSim and various runtime resources.
