/** Minimize the sum of squares of specified reaction moment and force
measures for a given joint, integrated over the phase. If the magnitude of
the gravity acceleration vector (Model::get_gravity()) is non-zero, then the
goal is normalized by the model's weight; otherwise, the goal is normalized
by the model's mass. We assume the system's mass is constant (that is,
MocoParameters do not affect mass).

In addition to specifying the joint and reaction measures, the user may
also specify the frame the loads are computed from ("parent" or "child"),
and the frame the loads are expressed in (any valid frame in the model).

Minimizing the y-direction reaction force on the child frame of the right
knee joint expressed in the right tibia frame:
@code
auto* cost = problem.addGoal<MocoJointReactionCost>();
cost->setName("tibiofemoral_compressive_force");
cost->setJointPath("/jointset/knee_r");
cost->setLoadsFrame("child");
cost->setExpressedInFramePath("/bodyset/tibia_r");
cost->setReactionMeasures({"force-y"});
@endcode

This cost requires realizing to the Acceleration stage.
