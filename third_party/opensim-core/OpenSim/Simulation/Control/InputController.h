/**
 * InputController is a simple intermediate abstract class for a Controller that
 * computes controls based on scalar values defined via a list Input.
 *
 * Concrete implementations of InputController must provide a relevant 
 * implementation for the computeControlsImpl() method. This method is called by
 * computeControls() only if the InputController has the correct number of 
 * connected Input controls. Otherwise, computeControls() does modify the
 * model controls vector. It is up to each concrete implementation class to 
 * define how the scalar values from the list Input are mapped to the controls 
 * for the actuators in the controller's ActuatorSet. Additionally, concrete 
 * implementations must implement getInputControlLabels() to provide a vector of
 * labels denoting the order and length of the scalar Input values expected by 
 * the controller. These labels may be useful in simulation tools (e.g., Moco)
 * to make connections between control signals from other sources 
 * (e.g., ControlDistributor) and the Input controls of the controller.
 *
 * InputController provides convenience methods for getting the names and
 * indexes of the controls for the actuators in the controller's ActuatorSet.
 * Non-scalar actuators will have multiple controls, and therefore have multiple
 * control names and indexes. Control information is only available after 
 * calling Model::finalizeConnections().
 *
 * Actuator control names and indexes are based on the convention used by the
 * utility function SimulationUtilities::createControlNamesFromModel(), which
 * returns control names and indexes based on the order of the actuators stored
 * in the model. However, we do not check if the order of the actuators stored
 * in the model matches the order of the controls in the underlying system. Use
 * the utility function SimulationUtilities::checkOrderSystemControls() to
 * perform this check when using this controller.
