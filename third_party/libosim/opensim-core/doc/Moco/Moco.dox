Moco is a part of %OpenSim for solving optimal control problems for
musculoskeletal systems defined as %OpenSim models.
The package has Python, MATLAB, and XML interfaces; the core
library is written in C++.

Here are some problems you can solve with Moco:

- Solve for the muscle activity that tracks a known motion.
- Solve for a new motion that optimizes some cost (e.g., effort).
- Solve for mass properties that minimize residual (unrealistic) forces.

@section latestrelease Latest release

The latest Moco features are included with the %OpenSim 4.5 release. [Learn about the new features here.](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=130187315)

@defgroup mocogoal Moco: Available goals

These are the goals available in Moco for use in your cost functional or as
endpoint constraints. If none of these satisfy your needs, you can define your
own using a plugin.
