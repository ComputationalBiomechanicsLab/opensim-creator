/** Solve the MocoProblem using the **tropter** direct collocation library.
**tropter** is a free and open-source C++ library that supports computing
the Jacobian and Hessian via either automatic differentiation or finite
differences, and uses IPOPT for solving the nonlinear optimization problem.

This class allows you to configure tropter's settings.

Supported optimization solvers
==============================
The following optimization solvers can be specified for the optim_solver
property:
- ipopt
- snopt

Using this solver in C++ requires that a tropter shared library is
available, but tropter header files are not required. No tropter symbols
are exposed in Moco's interface. */
