\section MocoStateTrackingGoal
The squared difference between a state variable
value and a reference state variable value, summed over the state variables for which a
reference is provided, and integrated over the phase. This can be used to
track joint angles, activations, etc.
The reference can be provided as a file name to a STO or CSV file (or
other file types for which there is a FileAdapter), or programmatically
as a TimeSeriesTable. If columns for rotational coordinates are in degrees,
those columns will be converted to radians.
Tracking problems in direct collocation perform best when tracking smooth
data, so it is recommended to filter the data in the reference you provide
to the cost.

## Scale factors

Use `addScaleFactor()` to add a MocoParameter to the MocoProblem that will
scale the tracking reference data associated with a state in the tracking cost.
Scale factors for this goal can be useful if the magnitude of the tracking
reference data is either unknown or unreliable (e.g., pelvis height).
Scale factors are applied to the tracking error calculations based on the
following equation:

    error = modelValue - scaleFactor * referenceValue

In other words, scale factors are applied when computing the tracking error for
each state, not to the reference data directly.

Adding a scale factor to a MocoStateTrackingGoal.
@code
auto* stateTrackingGoal = problem.addGoal<MocoStateTrackingGoal>();
...
stateTrackingGoal->addScaleFactor(
        'pelvis_ty_scale_factor', '/jointset/ground_pelvis/pelvis_ty/value',
        {0.5, 2.0});
