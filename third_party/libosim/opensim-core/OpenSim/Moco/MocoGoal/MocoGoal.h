/** A goal is a term in the cost functional to be minimized, or a set of endpoint
constraints that must lie within provided bounds. Goals depend on the
phase's initial and final states and controls, and optionally on the
integral of a quantity over the phase.
Not all goals support endpoint constraint mode; see
getSupportsEndpointConstraint(). If a goal does support endpoint constraint
mode, then the default mode is available via getMode(). Use endpoint
constraint mode if you require the goal to be met strictly and do not want
to allow a trade-off between this goal and other goals.
The calculation of the goal may differ between cost and endpoint constraint
modes; cost mode may require that outputs are squared, for example.

# Stage dependency
Some goals require less of IntegrandInput and GoalInput than others. To
ensure goals are computed efficiently, goals can specify a stage dependency,
which tells solvers what to do when preparing IntegrandInput and GoalInput.
Here are the expectations for each SimTK::Stage:

- SimTK::Stage::Topology: the time field of IntegrandInput and
    initial_time and final_time fields of GoalInput are available.
- SimTK::Stage::Model: controls fields of IntegrandInput and
    GoalInput are available.
- SimTK::Stage::Instance: MocoParameters are applied to the model.
- SimTK::Stage::Time: state variables (SimTK::State::getY(), etc.) are
    available, and SimTK::Stage::getTime() is updated.
- SimTK::Stage::Position: state, initial_state, and final_state can be used
    to compute position-dependent quantities.
- SimTK::Stage::Velocity: state, initial_state, and final_state can be used
    to compute velocity-dependent quantities.
- SimTK::Stage::Dynamics: state, initial_state, and final_state can be used
    to compute force-dependent quantities.
- SimTK::Stage::Acceleration: state, initial_state, and final_state can be
    used to compute acceleration-dependent quantities, such as body
    accelerations and joint reactions.

## Scale factors
Goals may include an option to add scale factors to the MocoProblem using
`appendScaleFactor()`, which takes a MocoScaleFactor object for its argument.
A copy of this component is added to the Model internal to MocoProblemRep and
its property value is optimized via a MocoParameter. Scale factor usage is
specific to each MocoGoal (if used at all).

@par For developers
Every time the problem is solved, a copy of this goal is used. An individual
instance of a goal is only ever used in a single problem. Therefore, there
is no need to clear cache variables that you create in initializeImpl().
Also, information stored in this goal does not persist across multiple
solves.

/** This goal requires the average speed of the system to match a desired

In endpoint constraint mode, the goal is computed as follows:

\f[
 v_\mathrm{des} - \frac{r_\mathrm{com}(t_f) - r_\mathrm{com}(t_i)}{t_f - t_i}
\f]

We use the following notation:
- \f$ v_\mathrm{des} \f$: desired average speed.
- \f$ r_\mathrm{com}(t) \f$: mass center position.
- \f$ t_i \f$: initial time.
- \f$ t_f \f$: final time.

In cost mode, the value of the goal is the above quantity squared.
