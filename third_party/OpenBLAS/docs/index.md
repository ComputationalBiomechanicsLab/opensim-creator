## Introduction

OpenBLAS is an optimized Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) library based on [GotoBLAS2](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-software/gotoblas2) 1.13 BSD version.

OpenBLAS implements low-level routines for performing linear algebra operations such as vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, linear combinations, and matrix multiplication. OpenBLAS makes these routines available on multiple platforms, covering server, desktop and mobile operating systems, as well as different architectures including x86, ARM, MIPS, PPC, RISC-V, and zarch.

The old GotoBLAS documentation can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/blob/develop/GotoBLAS_01Readme.txt).
