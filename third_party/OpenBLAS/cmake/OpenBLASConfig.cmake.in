# OpenBLASConfig.cmake
# --------------------
#
# OpenBLAS cmake module.
# This module sets the following variables in your project::
#
#   OpenBLAS_FOUND - true if OpenBLAS and all required components found on the system
#   OpenBLAS_VERSION - OpenBLAS version in format Major.Minor.Release
#   OpenBLAS_INCLUDE_DIRS - Directory where OpenBLAS header is located.
#   OpenBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR - same as DIRS
#   OpenBLAS_LIBRARIES - OpenBLAS library to link against.
#   OpenBLAS_LIBRARY - same as LIBRARIES
#
#
# Available components::
#
##   shared - search for only shared library
##   static - search for only static library
#   serial - search for unthreaded library
#   pthread - search for native pthread threaded library
#   openmp - search for OpenMP threaded library
#
#
# Exported targets::
#
# If OpenBLAS is found, this module defines the following :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED`
## target. Target is shared _or_ static, so, for both, use separate, not
## overlapping, installations. ::
#
#   OpenBLAS::OpenBLAS - the main OpenBLAS library #with header & defs attached.
#
#
# Suggested usage::
#
#   find_package(OpenBLAS)
#   find_package(OpenBLAS 0.2.20 EXACT CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS pthread)
#
#
# The following variables can be set to guide the search for this package::
#
#   OpenBLAS_DIR - CMake variable, set to directory containing this Config file
#   CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH - CMake variable, set to root directory of this package
#   PATH - environment variable, set to bin directory of this package
#   CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_OpenBLAS - CMake variable, disables
#     find_package(OpenBLAS) when not REQUIRED, perhaps to force internal build
