> A thin UI for building OpenSim models (ðŸš§ **ALPHA-STAGE SOFTWARE** ðŸš§)

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

`osmv` is a standalone UI for building [OpenSim](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core) models. It
is designed as a proof-of-concept GUI with the intent that some of its features may
be merged into the official [OpenSim GUI](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-gui).

`osmv` is designed to be an easy-to-build rapid prototyping UI platform. It mostly uses C/C++ that is directly 
integrated against the [OpenSim core API](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core) and only uses lightweight
open-source libraries (e.g. SDL2, GLEW, ImGui) that can be built from source on all target platforms. This
means that the osmv has direct access to the GPU and that it's fairly fast to add new GUI features.

# Downloads

**Alpha stage**: these download links are just updated whenever we get a clean build from CI. They are not formal releases and they are not tested. Please give osmv a try--and definitely report bugs--but you might find the quality level fairly low at the moment.

| OS | Comments |
| - | - |
| [Debian/Ubuntu](https://github.com/adamkewley/osmv/suites/2004144172/artifacts/40079334) | Should work on Debian Buster+ or Ubuntu16+ |
| [OSX (Catalina)](https://github.com/adamkewley/osmv/suites/2004144172/artifacts/40079335) | Should work on Catalina+, unsure about earlier versions |
| [Windows](https://github.com/adamkewley/osmv/suites/2004144172/artifacts/40079336) | Should work on Windows 10 |


# Building

Because things are still in alpha (and might change, a lot), we don't currently publish a full build guide. However, the build is designed to be easy to run on a blank machine, so there are end-to-end build scripts /w comments for building on each platform. Please read these:

| OS | Comments |
| - | - |
| [Ubuntu 20+/Debian Buster](scripts/debian-buster_e2e-build.sh) | Builds OpenSim+osmv from scratch |
| [Ubuntu Xenial](scripts/ubuntu-xenial_e2e-build.sh) | Downloads gcc-8 and builds OpenSim+osmv from scratch using that |
| [OSX (Catalina)](scripts/mac_catalina_10-15_build.sh) | Builds OpenSim+osmv from scratch using basic build toolchain (full XCode shouldn't be necessary) |
| [Windows 10](scripts/windows_e2e-build.bat) | Builds OpenSim+osmv using VS2019 |

These are the exact build scripts we use for continuous integratation (config [here](.github/workflows/continuous-integration-workflow.yml)). If you can't get a build working then it might be our fault. Check the [actions](https://github.com/adamkewley/osmv/actions) page to see if the build is passing CI on GitHub.
