## üëì Overview

![screenshot](docs/source/_static/screenshot.jpg)

OpenSim Creator (`osc`) is a standalone UI for building and editing
[OpenSim](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core) models. It's available
as a freestanding all-in-one [installer](../../releases/latest) for Windows 10,
MacOS (>= v14, Sonoma), and Ubuntu (>= 22.04, Jammy Jellyfish).

`osc` started development in 2021 in the [Biomechanical Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/biomechanical-engineering)
department at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/). Architecturally, `osc` is a C++ codebase
that is directly integrated against the [OpenSim core C++ API](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core). It
otherwise only uses lightweight open-source libraries that can easily be built from source
(e.g. [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/)) to implement the UI on all target platforms. This makes `osc`
fairly easy to build, integrate, and package.

## üìñ Citing/Acknowledging

OpenSim Creator doesn't have a central _written_ software publication that you can cite (yet üòâ). However, if you _need_ to directly cite OpenSim Creator (e.g. because you think it's relevant that you built a model with it), the closest thing you can use is our DOI-ed Zenodo releases (metadata available in this repo: `CITATION.cff`/`codemeta.json`):

> Kewley, A., Beesel, J., & Seth, A. (2025). OpenSim Creator (0.5.22). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15282275

If you need a general citation for the simulation/modelling technique, you can directly cite OpenSim via this paper:

> Seth A, Hicks JL, Uchida TK, Habib A, Dembia CL, et al. (2018) **OpenSim: Simulating musculoskeletal dynamics and neuromuscular control to study human and animal movement.** _PLOS Computational Biology_ 14(7): e1006223. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006223


# ‚ù§Ô∏è Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) which
currently funds OpenSim Creator's development through the "Essential Open Source Software
for Science" grant scheme (Chan Zuckerberg Initiative DAF, 2020-218896 (5022)).

We would also like to thank the [Department of Biomechanical Engineering at TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/biomechanical-engineering),
which has provided the necessary institutional support required to keep OpenSim Creator's
development supported and stable.

Finally, we would also like to thank the wider open-source community. OpenSim Creator
wouldn't be possible without using and learning from high-quality open-source libraries
and technical literature from thousands of contributors.
